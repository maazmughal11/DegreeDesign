# Degree Design 📅🎓

- App that allows students to log in and input taken and desirable courses & then generates a degree timetable based on prerequisites & course information 
- Allows admins to add, edit, and delete course information (e.g. prerequisites) after logging in

Technologies: Android Studio, Java, Git, Firebase, Jira

## Functionality

1. Students can log in and register, and then add courses they have taken as well as courses they want to take in the future. All of this can be readily edited and the input is sanitized.
2. Admins can log in and register, as well as add and delete courses, whilst also editing course information and prerequisites.
3. A degree timeline is generated for students based on their desirable courses and their subsequent prerequisities. (*Most Individual Input Here*)

## Running The App

The app can be run by pulling the repository to andriod studio, and then using an android phone emulator or through connecting an android phone via cable.
